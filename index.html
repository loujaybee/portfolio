        <p>Hey, I'm Lou.</p>

        <p> I'm a Javascript Engineer, Consultant and Writer. </p>

        <p>I'm currently helping FTSE100 companies deliver remarkable software with <a target="_blank" href="and.digital">AND Digital</a>.</p>

        <h2> Core beliefs </h2>

        <p> I believe that how we approach our work is more important than what we currently know. I believe that we're wrong more than we think, it's our job to find out where we're wrong. I believe that sharing our work, thinking and ideas is essential. I believe that we could do more to be more human in the workplace. And I believe that knowing the right questions is far more important than having the right answers...</p>

        <h2>What I'm currently working on</h2>

        <p><strong>Writing:</strong> <a href="https://thedevcoach.co.uk/the-best-software-developers-write-you-should-too/" target="_blank">I write</a> to share practical ways people in technology can work better. I take everything with a healthy dose of cynicism and like putting things under scrutiny. I also blend what I write about with my other interests; this just makes things more fun. I hope to inspire my readers to take more control and responsibility for their own happiness, freedom and success in all areas, not just at work but in everything.

        <p><strong>Reading:</strong> <a href="https://thedevcoach.co.uk/5-ways-improve-non-fiction-reading/" target="_blank">I read</a> as much as humanly possible. You can check out my <a href="http://thedevcoach.co.uk/reading-list/" target="_blank"> reading list </a> if you wish. And if you have a recommendation, please let me know!</p>

        <p><strong>Launching Splitoo:</strong> We created <a target="_blank" href="http://www.splitoo.com">Splitoo</a> (a web app) to make sharing recurring payments easier. With Splitoo you can share your netflix subscription with your family. Or, if you're savvy you can use it to setup a business. Think of it like the airbnb for everything. </p>

        <p><strong>Launching Hacktopia:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hacktopia.io">Hacktopia</a> is customisable web app that helps technology teams have a world-class hiring process. Hacktopia helps automate and refine the full hiring process, from initial contact, sending tech tests and scheduling interviews. This keeps the candidate up to date and free's development teams to do what they do best: Code, not HR.</p>

        <h2>One last thing...</h2>
        <p>I intentionally don't have a Portfolio. This free's my time to create (code and write) more and give back. I'd rather show you what I'm about then tell you. And I'd rather you check out my work and the impact it has, rather than bore you with implementation details.
