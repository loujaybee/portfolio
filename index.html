        <p>Hey, I'm Lou.</p>

        <p> I'm a Javascript Engineer & Writer. </p>

        <p> Welcome to my super brief about me page. </p>

        <h2> Core beliefs </h2>

        <p> I believe that how we approach our work is more important than what we currently know. I believe that we're
            wrong more than we think, it's our job to find out where we're wrong. I believe that sharing our work,
            thinking and ideas is essential. I believe that we could do more to be more human in the workplace. And I
            believe that knowing the right questions is far more important than having the right answers...</p>

        <h2>What I'm currently working on</h2>

        <p><strong>Growing Splitoo:</strong> We created <a target="_blank" href="http://www.splitoo.com">Splitoo</a> (a
            web app) to make sharing recurring payments easier. With Splitoo you can share things like your netflix
            subscription
            with your family. Or, if you're savvy you can use it to setup a business. Think of it like the airbnb for
            everything. </p>

        <p><strong>Writing:</strong> <a
                href="https://thedevcoach.co.uk/the-best-software-developers-write-you-should-too/" target="_blank">I
                write</a> to share practical ways people in technology can work better. I take everything with a healthy
            dose of cynicism and like putting things under scrutiny. I also blend what I write about with my other
            interests; this just makes things more fun. I hope to inspire my readers to take more control and
            responsibility for their own happiness, freedom and success in all areas, not just at work but in
            everything. To learn more checkout <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedevcoach.co.uk/">The Dev
                Coach</a>. Or you can subscribe to updates <a target="_blank" href="http://eepurl.com/cKuCIr">here</a>.

        <h2>One last thing...</h2>
        <p>I intentionally don't have a Portfolio. This free's my time to create (code and write) more and give back.
            I'd rather show you what I'm about then tell you. So feel free to check out: <a target="_blank"
