        <p>Hey, I'm Lou.</p>
        <p> I'm a Javascript Engineer & Writer. </p>
        <p> Welcome to my super brief about me page. </p>
        <h2> Core beliefs... </h2>
        <p> I believe that how we approach our work is more important than what we currently know. I believe that we're
            wrong more than we think, it's our job to find out where we're wrong. I believe that sharing our work,
            thinking and ideas is essential. I believe that we could do more to be more human in the workplace. And I
            believe that knowing the right questions is far more important than having the right answers...
        </p>

        <p>I intentionally don't have a Portfolio. This free's my time to create (code and write) more and give back.
